### Hi there 👋
I'm a professor of information technology &  analytics and environment, development & health at American University.
I have a joint appointment between two schools, Kogod School of Business and School of International Service.
I teach graduate data science courses, particularly big data analytics and text mining in R/RStudio and Python.
In addition, I teach undergraduate courses on the Edge of Technology and a Senior Capstone on Inclusive Sustainable Development.
I am currently working on using BERT and PyTorch for NLP analytics.
