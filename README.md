### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a full professor of Information Technology &  Analytics and Environment, Development & Health at American University.
I have a joint appointment between two schools, the Kogod School of Business and the School of International Service.
I teach graduate data science courses, particularly Advanced Text Analytics with AI and ML in R and Python using the Positron IDE.
In addition, I teach undergraduate courses on the Edge of Technology and a Senior Capstone on Inclusive Sustainable Development.
We are currently leveraging a suite of R and Python packages including: tm, tidytext, quanteda, Gensim, spaCy, TextBlob, PyTorch, Transformers for NLP analytics and GenerativeAI approaches.
