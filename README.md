### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a full professor of Information Technology &  Analytics and Environment, Development & Health at American University.
I have a joint appointment between two schools, the Kogod School of Business and the School of International Service.
I teach graduate data science courses, particularly big data analytics and text mining in R/RStudio and Python.
In addition, I teach undergraduate courses on the Edge of Technology and a Senior Capstone on Inclusive Sustainable Development.
I am currently working on using BERT and PyTorch for NLP analytics.
